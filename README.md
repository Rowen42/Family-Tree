# Family-Tree
Code written to display my family tree in an expandable format using Pandas and Graphviz. Displays the relationships between parents, children, siblings and marriages as well as gender.

When you hover over the nodes, you can see information about that person.
Each person is assigned a unique identifier so multiple people can have the same name.
An image of the person can be attached to a person.
The information in the svg is embedded so the tree can be shared.
